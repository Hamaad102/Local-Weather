# Local-Weather
A web app that uses the users IP address to find their general location to present their local weather. In response to the weather and month the background of the site will change to best represent the weather and the text will change to best represent the season/month.
The users IP is used over the built in Geolocation functionalty as that requires HTTPS certification in newer versions of Chrome. Please load scripts so that the essential API's are able to work their magic.
